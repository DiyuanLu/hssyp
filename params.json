  "body": "### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nTo classify Epilepsy seizure, we look for the EEG data in physionet database in https://physionet.org/. Since epilepsy seizure pattern differ by patient, we cannot apply the same regression based on one patient on another patient. Here EEG is taken during both day and night. EEG taken during day time has other activities also recorded, for e.g: Eye blinking, moving finger etc. This is noise in the EEG data. \r\n\r\nEvery EEG file is approximately one hour reading on every patient. 2 8  \r\n28\r\n frequencies are recorded per second / channel. So, there are overall 921600 readings available per channel/hour. This is very huge amount of data. We are mostly interested in the EEG which is during the seizure and before/after. \r\n\r\nOnce we filter physionet database by the above requirement, we apply Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT) on these files. Since we have 2 8  \r\n28\r\n frequencies recorded per second, we pass the mother wavelet through 8 filter bands to reduce the dimension.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2016, Hannah Bend, Sanjay Tiwari, Sathish Kumar, Yohann Smadja.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
